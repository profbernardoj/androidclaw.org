# Workflows — SolanaClaw

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Portfolio Overview
> "Show me my Solana positions"

Agent presents: SOL balance (staked + liquid), SPL token holdings with current values, DeFi positions, and total portfolio value. All in one view.

### 2. Swap Route Optimization
> "Best way to swap 100 SOL for USDC?"

Agent checks Jupiter for optimal routes, compares price impact, shows fee breakdown, and presents the best option. Does not execute — user swaps manually.

### 3. Validator Analysis
> "Should I switch validators?"

Agent compares current validator against top performers: commission, skip rate, APY, stake concentration, and jito tips. Recommends if a switch makes sense.

### 4. Protocol Research
> "Tell me about [new Solana protocol]"

Agent researches: team, audit status, TVL, time live, user count, smart contract verification, and community sentiment. Presents a risk-reward assessment.

### 5. Airdrop Check
> "Am I eligible for any Solana airdrops?"

Agent checks tracked wallet addresses against known airdrop criteria, token claim pages, and community-compiled eligibility lists.

### 6. Network Status
> "Is Solana working normally?"

Agent checks: current TPS, slot times, recent failed transactions rate, any validator issues, and community reports of problems.

### 7. DeFi Yield Comparison
> "Best SOL staking yields right now?"

Agent compares: native staking APY, Marinade (mSOL), Jito (jitoSOL), and other liquid staking options. Notes lock-up terms and risks.

### 8. NFT Floor Watch
> "How's the Mad Lads floor?"

Agent checks floor price, 24h volume, listed count, and recent sales for tracked collections.

### 9. Transaction Lookup
> "What happened in this transaction?" (paste tx hash)

Agent fetches the transaction details from Solscan, explains what it did (swap, stake, NFT trade, etc.), and shows the value flow.

### 10. Governance Participation
> "Any active DAO votes I should know about?"

Agent checks Realms and other Solana governance platforms for active proposals in tracked DAOs, with summaries and deadlines.
