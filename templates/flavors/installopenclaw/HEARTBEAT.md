# HEARTBEAT.md — InstallOpenClaw

## Setup Progress
- Check `memory/setup-progress.md` for where the user is in their journey
- If a setup step was started but not completed, offer to help finish it

## System Health
- Basic check: is OpenClaw running correctly?
- Are any configured skills or services in an error state?
- Any pending updates available?

## First-Week Engagement
- During the first 7 days after install, be extra proactive:
  - Day 1-2: Help with basic setup (email, calendar, or first useful skill)
  - Day 3-4: Introduce one new capability
  - Day 5-7: Suggest a flavor upgrade if the user's interests are clear

## After First Week
- Reduce to standard heartbeat behavior
- Focus on system health and service availability

## Quiet Hours
- Between 22:00–07:00: HEARTBEAT_OK unless the user explicitly asked for something
