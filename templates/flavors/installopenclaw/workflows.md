# Workflows — InstallOpenClaw

## Example Use Cases

### 1. First Run
> "I just installed OpenClaw — now what?"

Agent welcomes the user, checks system status, and walks through the first setup steps: connecting a service, testing a command, and setting up the first useful automation.

### 2. Connect Email
> "Set up my email"

Agent walks through: `gog auth` for Gmail, testing the connection, checking unread messages, and setting up a morning digest cron job. Step by step with explanations.

### 3. What Can You Do?
> "What can you help me with?"

Agent presents capabilities organized by category: productivity, communication, smart home, finance, development. Suggests starting with the easiest win based on what the user has available.

### 4. Find My Flavor
> "Which flavor should I use?"

Agent asks a few questions about the user's interests and needs, then recommends the best EverClaw flavor with a clear explanation of what it adds.

### 5. Install a Skill
> "I want to control my smart home"

Agent identifies the right skill (homeassistant-skill, openhue, etc.), runs SkillGuard security scan, explains what it does, and walks through installation and configuration.

### 6. Troubleshooting
> "Something isn't working"

Agent diagnoses: checks OpenClaw status, reviews recent errors, tests key services, and provides clear, actionable fixes with explanations.

### 7. Set Up a Reminder
> "Remind me to call Mom on Sunday"

Agent creates the reminder using the simplest available method (cron job or Apple Reminders on macOS). Celebrates the small win — "Your first automation is live! 🎉"

### 8. Upgrade to a Flavor
> "I want to go deeper on investing"

Agent explains what InvestClaw adds (portfolio tracking, market alerts, DeFi monitoring), installs the flavor template pack, and walks through initial configuration.

### 9. Morning Briefing Setup
> "I want a daily briefing every morning"

Agent sets up BriefingClaw's morning cron job with the user's topic interests, explains how it works, and shows them what tomorrow's briefing will look like.

### 10. Understand the Sovereignty Path
> "How do I own my own AI?"

Agent explains the journey: start on a VM or existing machine → experience the value → get your own hardware (ClawBox) → stake MOR for permanent inference → full sovereignty. No pressure, just clarity.
