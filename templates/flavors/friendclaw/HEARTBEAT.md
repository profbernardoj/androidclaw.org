## Birthday Check
- Check `memory/contacts/` for birthdays in the next 7 days
- If a birthday is tomorrow, remind tonight (gift, card, message)
- If a birthday is in 3-5 days and a gift hasn't been noted, suggest planning

## Check-in Nudge
- Check `memory/contacts/` for close friends not contacted in >30 days
- Suggest a natural reason to reach out (shared interest, recent news, "just checking in")
- Limit to 1-2 suggestions per heartbeat — don't overwhelm

## Event Prep
- Check calendar for social events in the next 48 hours
- Remind about RSVPs, gifts, or contributions needed

## Quiet Hours
- Between 22:00–08:00: only alert for same-day birthdays or events
