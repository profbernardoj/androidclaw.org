# Workflows — DeepSeekClaw

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Local Model Setup
> "Set up DeepSeek locally"

Agent walks through Ollama installation, model pull, configuration, and verification. Tailored to hardware (GPU vs CPU, available RAM).

### 2. Model Selection
> "Should I use DeepSeek or Claude for this task?"

Agent evaluates the task type (code, reasoning, creative, analysis) and recommends the best model based on known strengths and cost.

### 3. Code Generation
> "Write a Python script to parse CSV and generate a report"

Agent routes to DeepSeek-Coder for code tasks, generating well-structured code with error handling and documentation.

### 4. Cost Analysis
> "How much am I spending on inference?"

Agent reviews usage logs, calculates costs by model and provider, and compares to alternative pricing. Suggests optimizations.

### 5. Benchmark Comparison
> "How does DeepSeek V3 compare to GPT-4 on reasoning?"

Agent presents benchmark data from recent evaluations, with specific scores on math, code, and reasoning tasks. Sources cited.

### 6. Fine-tuning Guidance
> "Can I fine-tune DeepSeek for my domain?"

Agent explains: which models support fine-tuning, hardware requirements, data preparation, training process, and expected costs/benefits.

### 7. Model Update Check
> "Any new DeepSeek models?"

Agent searches for recent releases, changelog highlights, benchmark improvements, and whether an upgrade is worth it.

### 8. Inference Optimization
> "My local inference is slow"

Agent checks: model size vs available VRAM, quantization options, batch settings, context length impact, and suggests optimizations.
