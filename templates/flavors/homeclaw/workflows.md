# Workflows — HomeClaw

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Scene Control
> "Good night" / "Movie time" / "I'm leaving"

The agent triggers the configured scene — adjusting lights, locks, thermostat, and other devices in one command.

### 2. Device Troubleshooting
> "The living room light isn't responding"

The agent checks device status, verifies connectivity, attempts a restart/re-ping, and reports back. If it can't fix it, suggests manual steps.

### 3. Energy Check
> "How much energy did we use this week?"

The agent pulls energy monitoring data, compares to recent averages, identifies peak usage periods, and suggests any easy wins for reduction.

### 4. Climate Adjustment
> "It's too warm upstairs"

The agent checks the thermostat setting, indoor temperature sensors, and outdoor conditions. Suggests adjustments or automation changes to balance temperatures.

### 5. Security Check
> "Is everything locked up?"

The agent checks all door locks, window sensors, cameras, and alarm status. Reports a clear all-secure or flags anything open/unlocked.

### 6. Maintenance Lookup
> "When did I last change the HVAC filter?"

The agent checks the maintenance schedule and reports last replacement date, days since, and whether it's due.

### 7. Create an Automation
> "Turn on the porch light at sunset every day"

The agent creates the automation rule in your smart home platform and confirms it's active.

### 8. Guest Access
> "Give the housesitter access to the front door for next week"

The agent sets up temporary access with an expiration date and reminds you to revoke it afterward.
