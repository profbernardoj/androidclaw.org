# HEARTBEAT.md — OfficeClaw

## Calendar Check
- Check for meetings in the next 2 hours
- If a meeting is <30 min away and has no prep brief in memory, generate one
- Flag any scheduling conflicts

## Task Tracker
- Check `memory/tasks.md` for items due today
- Alert on anything overdue

## Inbox Scan
- Quick scan for urgent work emails (from direct reports, manager, key stakeholders)
- Only surface if action is needed before next meeting

## Quiet Hours
- Between 20:00–07:00 local time, only alert for calendar conflicts or VIP messages
- Weekend: only alert if explicitly asked to work weekends
