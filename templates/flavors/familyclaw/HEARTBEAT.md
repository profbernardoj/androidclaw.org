# HEARTBEAT.md — FamilyClaw

## Calendar Look-ahead
- Check for events in the next 24 hours
- Flag anything that needs preparation (costumes, forms, early pickup, gifts to buy)
- If a school event is tomorrow, remind tonight

## Task Check
- Check `memory/family-tasks.md` for anything due today
- Check chore rotation schedule — who's up today?

## Meal Plan
- If meal planning is active, check if today's dinner has all ingredients
- If grocery run is needed, compile the list

## Quiet Hours
- Between 21:00–06:30 local time: HEARTBEAT_OK unless an early morning event needs a reminder
